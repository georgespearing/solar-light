Rebuild the Solar lights

1 AA Battery with a small solar panel to light a string of lights. 

Using the solar panel, this will automatically come on at night and turn off during the day. 

Know Issues / Room for Improvement

- There is no charge protection from the solar panel to battery
- R1 can be used for "tune" when the lights will turn on
- The lights will say on all night, but without a very sunny day afterward, it will die quickly the next night
